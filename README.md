# Gallery

Gallery lets me host and view any collection(s) of images.
See the description for the repository.

## Uses
A simple web-app I use to help me do a few things:

* Host my many desktop backgrounds outside of my .files repository, so it
  doesn't get huge with hundreds of high-resolution images. This is hosted
  on a droplet.
* Run the server locally to serve all of my screenshots that I've taken.
  doing this lets me find an old screenshot by image, instead of its filenames,
  which only give timestamp information.
* As a dependency for my bookshelf project. Gallery helps display my to-read
  bookshelf via their covers, so that I can identify them visually instead of
  just by their titles.

There are some important things left to do to make this nicer to use. See the
Issues.
