# README

This directory is here for coverage reasons. Gallery doesn't support nested
directory structures (although it _could_). I personally have no reason to
implement this feature because none of my use cases require it. I suppose if
anyone ever uses this themselves and needs it, I'll go ahead and do the work
for it. It would be a bit challenging, I think, but fun.
